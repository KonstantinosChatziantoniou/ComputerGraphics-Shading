# ComputerGraphics-Shading

In the previous assignments (https://github.com/KonstantinosChatziantoniou/ComputerGraphics-TransformationProjection, https://github.com/KonstantinosChatziantoniou/ComputerGraphics-TriangleFilling)
the color of each triangle is known.

In this one, we have to calculate the color of each point, using the light coefficients (ambient diffusal specular) and a light source. The code for 
3d transformation, projection and the basic painting routine are the same as before.

This assignment introduces Gouraud and Phong shading.

The `demo.m` shows the contribution of each lighting type and the final image for the 2 shading techniques.
